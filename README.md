# ⚗️ Jaber Chem

**Jaber Chem** is an interactive educational game that makes learning chemistry fun and engaging. Built as part of a team at Gamifier, the project features a series of mini-games focused on teaching concepts like electron configuration and orbital notation. Inspired by *WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!* (2003), it delivers fast-paced, chemistry-themed gameplay.

## 🔬 Game Features

### 🔹 Electron Configuration

Electrons are arranged into shells following the formula `2n²`, where **n** is the shell level:

| Shell | Max Electrons |
|-------|----------------|
| K (n=1) | 2             |
| L (n=2) | 8             |
| M (n=3) | 18            |
| N (n=4) | 32            |
| O (n=5) | 50            |
| P (n=6) | 72            |

**Implementation:**  
Electrons are visually distributed in a circular pattern. For example:
- Total circle: 360°
- Divide by number of electrons to calculate spacing
- Spawn an electron at each angle increment

This provides a dynamic and visually clear representation of atomic structure.

### 🔸 Orbital Notation

Orbital notation takes into account:
- Principal energy level (shell)
- Subshell (s, p, d, f)
- Maximum electrons per subshell

**Automation:**  
A script was created to automatically calculate and display orbital notations for each element, making the game adaptable and educational.
